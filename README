This probably won't work for you, but who knows.

Works very similarly to i3blocks, because that's where I came from before DWM
times. Most of the i3blocks scripts will work. The program will take only the
first line, DWM bar does not support colors anyway (at least to my knowledge).

Some frequently called things are implemented straight in C, to save resources.
